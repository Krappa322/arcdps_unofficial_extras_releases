# ArcDPS Unofficial Extras
This program does little on its own. It is mainly aimed to provide other plugins with additional information.

What it does directly:
- Lock mouse while camera is moving (hidden when rightclick)
- Lock mouse to the game window
- Presets for graphic settings that allow switching between them fast
- Save/Load Keybinds by Profession (previously part of arcdps)
- Save/Load Keybinds by Elite (previously part of arcdps)
- Options to hide top-right widgets (previously part of arcdps)

What it provides for other addons:
- Information about the squad (join/leave party/squad, role, subgroup, read-state)
- Event when the language is changed
- Events and exports to read out keybinds
- Utilities to translate keybinds
- Utilities to convert to/from msvc to gw2 internal keybinds
- Events when Chat messages are sent/received

**This addon, like arcdps, hooks network data. To do so it makes runtime modifications to the GW2 executable.**

**Use at your own risk.**

## Installation
Requires [ArcDPS](https://www.deltaconnected.com/arcdps/).

Download the latest [arcdps_unofficial_extras.dll](https://github.com/Krappa322/arcdps_unofficial_extras_releases/releases/latest) from the Releases page. Drag and drop arcdps_unofficial_extras.dll into the gw2 directory (same directory as where arcdps d3d11.dll is)

## Usage
If installed correctly, you should see an "Unoffical Extras Options" menu where auto-updating can be configured. Other addons that integrate with unofficial_extras should automatically start working, no additional configuration required. The addon does nothing on its own. 

## Source Code
unofficial_extras is currently closed source. This in compliance with requests made by Guild Wars 2 community managers, who have requested for similar addons (that read runtime data from the GW2 executable) to be closed source.

## Issues and requests
Please report issues and requests using the github issue tracker, or on the [Elite Insights Discord](https://discord.gg/T4kSbKJ5Sf)

## For Developers
